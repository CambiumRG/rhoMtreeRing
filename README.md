# ρ-MtreeRing
## What is ρ-MtreeRing?
ρ-MtreeRing is an Free Open Source Software for tree rings microdensity analysis on Shiny. It is developed from MtreeRing (AÑADIR REPOSITORIO/CITA).

## Installing ρ-MtreeRing
Download **app.R** file on your computer and launch it on R or RStudio. We highly recommend open Shiny interface on browser by clicking on the upper-left displayed option `Open in Browser`.

## Using ρ-MtreeRing

### Data Loading
**Upload Sample Image**  
At *Image Upload* box, browse and select a X-ray digitalized image from your computer and click on `Load`. Image will be displayed on the *Image Preview* box and can be cropped to select the area of interest or rotated to led recent years or bark on the left of the image.

**Light Calibration**  
Fill available thickness and intensity boxes or load it from a file from your computer from stepped calibration wedge values. Afterwards, regression algorithm can be chosen from `Local regression` or `Cubic smoothing spline`. Once those data are fulfilled, click on the `Plot` button. Therefore, steps and regression curve will be displayed from *XRing* (AÑADIR REPOSITORIO/CITA) based script.

### Analysis

**Entry Sample Info**  
Complete Sample ID, Year of obtention. DPI and Sample thickness are required to obtain comparative values of ring width and density among different samples.

At *Path Info* box you can select the desired path mode (pay attention to ring detection requirements) and number of pixels selected to extract density profile.

**Path Creation**  

In the *Main Window*, firstly select path limits by double-left-clicking on the left side (recent years) of the sample to place the beginning of the segment and continue delimiting path segments across the sample perpendicularly to ring limits.
Path width for density extraction can be changed throughout the entire analysis. 

**Ring Detection and Editing** 

Once path is set, confirm the ring selection method options at *Detection Options* box and click on `Ring Detection`.
If, unfortunately, automatic ring detection did not work properly, you can modify ring borders on `Ring Editing` mode. One click on the desired border set a new border, while you can select one or multiple ring borders by clicking and dragging and delete them clicking on `Delete Border`.


**Earlywood/Latewood Detection and Editing**
